# tsontology summary card

**audience:** clinical  
**domain:** clinical  
**observation mode:** irregular  
**overall reliability:** 0.796 (high)

## Executive summary

This looks like a clinical monitoring dataset spanning about 3 subject(s) with roughly 2 signal channel(s) per subject. In plain language, the strongest signals in its structure are that complexity is very high, trend strength is high, and observation irregularity is high. Overall evidence quality for this profile is high.

## Dataset facts

| field | value |
|---|---:|
| n_subjects | 3 |
| n_channels_median | 2 |
| length_median | 66 |
| dominant_axes | complexity, trendness, sampling_irregularity |
| reliability | 0.796 (high) |

## Top structure axes

| axis | plain-language label | score | level | what it usually means |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| complexity | complexity | 0.822 | very high | the signal contains rich local variation rather than one simple repeating template |
| trendness | trend strength | 0.715 | high | there is meaningful slow movement or baseline shift rather than pure fluctuation |
| sampling_irregularity | observation irregularity | 0.569 | high | measurements do not arrive on a clean, even grid, so timing and missingness matter |
| predictability | predictability | 0.554 | high | recent history carries usable information about what comes next |

## Main takeaways

- complexity: the signal contains rich local variation rather than one simple repeating template.
- trend strength: there is meaningful slow movement or baseline shift rather than pure fluctuation.
- observation irregularity: measurements do not arrive on a clean, even grid, so timing and missingness matter.

## Main watchouts

- Watch observation irregularity: measurements do not arrive on a clean, even grid, so timing and missingness matter.
- Watch eventness and burstiness: rare bursts or event-like excursions dominate the behavior more than smooth continuous change.
- Watch drift and nonstationarity: the data-generating behavior changes over time rather than staying stable.

## Analysis opportunities

- Opportunity in trend strength: there is meaningful slow movement or baseline shift rather than pure fluctuation.
- Opportunity in predictability: recent history carries usable information about what comes next.
- Opportunity in rhythmicity: the data contain repeating or oscillatory patterns that may support seasonal or frequency-aware analysis.

## Recommended next actions

1. Expect single-number summaries to miss part of the structure; representation learning may help.
2. Include detrending or low-frequency structure checks in the workflow and compare trend-aware baselines.
3. Keep explicit timestamps and avoid blindly forcing the data onto a regular grid too early.
4. Simple baselines and short-horizon forecasting are worth trying before more complex models.
5. Benchmark irregular-time models or continuous-time/state-space baselines; avoid evaluating only on resampled regular grids.
6. Channels are observed asynchronously; models that treat missingness and observation timing as signal should be prioritized.

## Interpretation notes

- Irregular inputs are profiled without interpolation; when explicit timestamps are available, spectral proxies use Lomb-Scargle style irregular-spectrum estimates.
- For irregularly sampled inputs with explicit timestamps, frequency-aware proxies use Lomb-Scargle style irregular-spectrum estimates; very sparse or strongly gappy series should still be interpreted conservatively.
- Reliability scores combine proxy coverage and data-support heuristics.
- Irregular inputs use timestamp-aware spectral estimators when timestamps are available, but frequency-aware axes remain conservative under heavy gaps or sparse support.
