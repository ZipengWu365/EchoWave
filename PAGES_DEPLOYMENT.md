# GitHub Pages-ready similarity demos

This repository now ships a GitHub Pages-ready static site bundle and workflow files. Deployment itself still happens in your GitHub repository, not inside the Python package.

- Push the repo with docs/ and .github/workflows/pages.yml included.
- Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings or rely on the workflow to publish the docs bundle.
- Set the README live-demo link to the published Pages URL once the first deployment succeeds.
- Use docs/playground.html as the product demo landing page if you want a tighter viral loop than the full docs homepage.
