# What is tsontology?

**Structure-aware dataset profiling for time-series data.**

tsontology converts a time-series dataset into a structural profile: ontology axis scores, subdimensions, proxy metrics, reliability summaries, archetypes, task hints, and dataset cards.

## What the package is

A dataset-characterization layer that sits between raw time-series data and downstream modelling. It helps researchers understand what kind of temporal structure they have before they pick models, compare benchmarks, or write dataset documentation.

## What the package is not

It is not a forecasting library, not a classifier, not a replacement for MNE/nilearn/pandas/xarray, and not just another bag-of-features extractor. It profiles datasets rather than training task models.

## Who should use it

Researchers and engineers working with fMRI, EEG, clinical monitoring, wearable longitudinal cohorts, environmental sensors, industrial telemetry, tabular time-series lakes, and event streams.

## Core outputs

- ontology axes
- subdimension scores
- raw proxy metrics
- archetype labels
- task hints
- reliability and evidence
- dataset card JSON/Markdown
- plain-language summary card
- narrative report
- case gallery
- similarity report
- rolling similarity diagnostics
- hot case gallery
- project homepage HTML
- agent-driven execution plan
- compact agent context bundle

## Supported input families

- dense NumPy-like arrays
- pandas DataFrame and tabular file paths
- FMRIInput and EEGInput typed wrappers
- irregular timestamped subjects
- event streams
- MNE-like and xarray-like objects

## The main question it answers

What kind of time-series dataset do I have, and what does that imply for analysis and modelling?

## Ontology axes

| axis | description |
|---|---|
| sampling_irregularity | Irregular timestamps, missingness, asynchrony, and observation-grid instability. |
| noise_contamination | High-frequency contamination, residual roughness, and noise-like spectra. |
| predictability | Extent to which the near future is recoverable from the recent past. |
| drift_nonstationarity | Temporal instability of distributional or spectral structure. |
| trendness | Strength of slow, directional, low-frequency movement. |
| rhythmicity | Strength of periodic, oscillatory, or quasi-periodic repetition. |
| complexity | Pattern richness, local unpredictability, and resistance to simple compression. |
| nonlinearity_chaoticity | Departure from linear-Gaussian dependence and time-symmetry. |
| eventness_burstiness | Dominance of sparse, bursty, or sharp episodic excursions. |
| regime_switching | Evidence for discrete structural shifts or switching dynamics. |
| coupling_networkedness | Strength and organization of cross-channel dependence. |
| heterogeneity | Variation in structure across subjects, conditions, or channels. |

# tsontology API reference

## core profiling

### `profile_dataset`

**Signature:** `profile_dataset(data, *, domain=None, timestamps=None, time_axis=0, channel_axis=-1, subject_axis=0, sampling_rate=None, tr=None, channel_names=None, roi_names=None, network_labels=None, subject_ids=None, metadata=None, bootstrap=0, random_state=None) -> DatasetProfile`

**Purpose:** Primary entry point. Profile an entire dataset as a dataset.

**Why this API exists:** The core design choice of tsontology is that the object of interest is the dataset, not just a single series. This function aggregates unit-level signals, multivariate structure, cohort variation, and observation characteristics into one profile.

**When to use it:** Use when you want the ontology axes, archetypes, task hints, reliability, and dataset-card outputs for a whole dataset or cohort.

**Returns:** DatasetProfile

**Accepted inputs / context:**

- 1D/2D/3D arrays
- pandas DataFrame or tabular file path
- FMRIInput / EEGInput
- IrregularTimeSeriesInput
- EventStreamInput
- MNE-like or xarray-like object

**Inspect these outputs:**

- profile.axes
- profile.subdimensions
- profile.archetypes
- profile.task_hints
- profile.reliability
- profile.to_card_json()

**Recommended environments:** notebook, python_script, cli_batch, pandas_pipeline, neuro_stack, ml_benchmark

### `profile_series`

**Signature:** `profile_series(series, *, timestamps=None, domain=None) -> SeriesProfile`

**Purpose:** Profile a single univariate series when a full dataset object is not needed.

**Why this API exists:** Users often want a lightweight sanity-check before moving to dataset-level profiling. This function keeps the interface simple for one series while still using the same ontology machinery.

**When to use it:** Use for quick checks, demos, or when your data truly consist of a single univariate stream.

**Returns:** SeriesProfile

**Accepted inputs / context:**

- 1D array-like series
- optional timestamps

**Inspect these outputs:**

- profile.axes
- profile.metrics
- profile.notes
- profile.to_markdown()

**Recommended environments:** notebook, python_script

## profile outputs

### `DatasetProfile`

**Signature:** `DatasetProfile(...)`

**Purpose:** Rich result object returned by profile_dataset.

**Why this API exists:** A structural profile has both machine-readable and human-readable uses. The result object keeps raw metrics, ontology scores, notes, evidence, and rendering helpers together.

**When to use it:** Use after profiling to export reports, cards, or JSON payloads for downstream pipelines.

**Returns:** Dataclass-like object with rendering methods

**Accepted inputs / context:**

- created by profile_dataset

**Inspect these outputs:**

- to_dict()
- to_json()
- to_markdown()
- to_card_json()
- to_card_markdown()
- to_summary_card_markdown()
- to_narrative_report()

**Recommended environments:** notebook, python_script, cli_batch, ml_benchmark

### `SeriesProfile`

**Signature:** `SeriesProfile(...)`

**Purpose:** Result object returned by profile_series.

**Why this API exists:** Mirrors DatasetProfile for single-series inspection while keeping the same rendering ergonomics.

**When to use it:** Use when a quick series-level inspection is enough.

**Returns:** Dataclass-like object with rendering methods

**Accepted inputs / context:**

- created by profile_series

**Inspect these outputs:**

- to_dict()
- to_json()
- to_markdown()
- to_card_json()
- to_summary_card_markdown()
- to_narrative_report()

**Recommended environments:** notebook, python_script

## typed semantic inputs

### `FMRIInput`

**Signature:** `FMRIInput(values, tr=None, timestamps=None, roi_names=None, network_labels=None, subject_ids=None, ...) `

**Purpose:** Typed wrapper for fMRI time-series collections.

**Why this API exists:** Neuroimaging arrays often lose semantic context such as TR, ROI names, and network labels. The wrapper preserves those pieces so fMRI-specific proxies and network summaries can run correctly.

**When to use it:** Use when you have subject × time × ROI data or ROI time-series and want neuro-aware profiling.

**Returns:** Typed input object for profile_dataset

**Accepted inputs / context:**

- NumPy-like fMRI arrays
- optional ROI names
- optional network labels
- optional TR

**Inspect these outputs:**

- fmri_metrics plugin
- coupling_networkedness
- heterogeneity
- task_hints

**Recommended environments:** notebook, python_script, neuro_stack, ml_benchmark

### `EEGInput`

**Signature:** `EEGInput(values, sampling_rate=None, timestamps=None, channel_names=None, subject_ids=None, montage_name=None, ...) `

**Purpose:** Typed wrapper for EEG/MEG-style multichannel recordings.

**Why this API exists:** Electrophysiology users need channel names and sampling rate to unlock bandpower and rhythmicity-aware proxies. A typed wrapper is cleaner than overloading raw arrays with ad-hoc kwargs.

**When to use it:** Use when you have dense multichannel neural recordings and want domain-aware spectral summaries.

**Returns:** Typed input object for profile_dataset

**Accepted inputs / context:**

- NumPy-like EEG arrays
- sampling rate
- channel names

**Inspect these outputs:**

- eeg_bandpower plugin
- rhythmicity
- noise_contamination
- alpha_peak_prominence

**Recommended environments:** notebook, python_script, neuro_stack, ml_benchmark

### `IrregularSubjectInput / IrregularTimeSeriesInput`

**Signature:** `IrregularSubjectInput(values, timestamps, channel_names=None, metadata=None); IrregularTimeSeriesInput(subjects, domain=None, ...) `

**Purpose:** Represent timestamped irregular or asynchronous observations explicitly.

**Why this API exists:** Irregular data should not be silently coerced into regular grids. These wrappers preserve real timestamps, per-channel asynchrony, and missing support so irregular-aware proxies and reliability caveats can be computed honestly.

**When to use it:** Use for ICU vitals, clinical monitoring, sparse observational cohorts, or any nonuniformly sampled series.

**Returns:** Typed input objects for profile_dataset

**Accepted inputs / context:**

- per-subject irregular value arrays
- parallel timestamp arrays
- optional channel names

**Inspect these outputs:**

- sampling_irregularity
- irregular_observation plugin
- reliability notes

**Recommended environments:** notebook, python_script, pandas_pipeline, cli_batch

### `EventStreamInput`

**Signature:** `EventStreamInput(timestamps, channels=None, values=None, subjects=None, event_types=None, ...) `

**Purpose:** Represent sparse event streams such as alarms, coded events, transactions, or interventions.

**Why this API exists:** A stream of timestamped events is not the same as a dense sampled signal. This wrapper lets tsontology estimate burstiness, event-type diversity, and event-stream archetypes without pretending the data are regular arrays.

**When to use it:** Use for sparse operational events, treatment events, alarms, clicks, or transactional logs.

**Returns:** Typed input object for profile_dataset

**Accepted inputs / context:**

- event timestamps
- optional event labels/channels
- optional values/marks

**Inspect these outputs:**

- event_stream plugin
- eventness_burstiness
- archetypes

**Recommended environments:** notebook, python_script, cli_batch, pandas_pipeline

## ontology inspection

### `schema_dict / get_schema`

**Signature:** `schema_dict() -> dict; get_schema() -> tuple[AxisSpec, ...]`

**Purpose:** Expose the stable ontology schema programmatically.

**Why this API exists:** An ontology-driven library must make its schema inspectable and versioned. These functions let downstream tools, dataset cards, and documentation stay aligned with the real axis/subdimension/proxy map.

**When to use it:** Use when building dashboards, validators, reports, or benchmark cards around tsontology.

**Returns:** Schema dictionary or typed schema tuple

**Accepted inputs / context:**

- none

**Inspect these outputs:**

- axes
- subdimensions
- proxy names
- schema_version

**Recommended environments:** notebook, python_script, cli_batch, ml_benchmark

## extensibility

### `register_adaptor / register_plugin / clear_custom_extensions`

**Signature:** `register_adaptor(adaptor); register_plugin(plugin); clear_custom_extensions()`

**Purpose:** Extend tsontology to new data containers and domain-specific metrics.

**Why this API exists:** Cross-disciplinary infrastructure must be extensible. Adaptors let the package ingest new object types; plugins let communities add domain metrics without forking the ontology core.

**When to use it:** Use when integrating a local data object, a lab-specific pipeline, or new domain metrics.

**Returns:** Registry side-effects

**Accepted inputs / context:**

- custom adaptor objects
- custom plugin objects

**Inspect these outputs:**

- plugin_metrics
- metadata['native_adaptor']
- custom notes

**Recommended environments:** python_script, neuro_stack, ml_benchmark, pandas_pipeline

## plain-language communication

### `summary_card / narrative_report / profile.to_summary_card_* / profile.to_narrative_report`

**Signature:** `summary_card(profile, audience='general', format='markdown'); narrative_report(profile, audience='general', format='markdown'); DatasetProfile.to_summary_card_markdown(); DatasetProfile.to_narrative_report()`

**Purpose:** Turn a structural profile into something a non-method user can read quickly.

**Why this API exists:** A cross-disciplinary tool must explain itself to clinicians, operators, product teams, and collaborators who do not want to inspect raw proxy metrics. These APIs convert the same profile into a summary card and a prose narrative without hiding the underlying evidence.

**When to use it:** Use when presenting results to domain experts, attaching a profile to a dataset handoff, or writing methods-light project notes.

**Returns:** Markdown/JSON plain-language reports

**Accepted inputs / context:**

- DatasetProfile or SeriesProfile
- optional audience label such as general, clinical, product, or neuroscience

**Inspect these outputs:**

- executive summary
- top structure axes
- watchouts
- recommended next actions
- narrative report sections

**Recommended environments:** notebook, python_script, cli_batch

## built-in guidance

### `case_gallery`

**Signature:** `case_gallery(domain=None, audience=None, environment=None, format='markdown')`

**Purpose:** Browse high-visibility cross-disciplinary use cases where tsontology fits naturally.

**Why this API exists:** New users often understand a tool fastest through concrete cases instead of abstract API descriptions. The case gallery shows popular time-series settings such as web traffic, retail demand, energy load, wearables, ICU monitoring, and fMRI.

**When to use it:** Use when onboarding collaborators, choosing demos, or matching the package to a real-world workflow.

**Returns:** Markdown/text/JSON case gallery

**Accepted inputs / context:**

- optional domain, audience, and environment filters

**Inspect these outputs:**

- popular cases
- recommended entrypoints
- what to show non-method users
- practical value

**Recommended environments:** notebook, python_script, cli_batch

### `about / api_reference / scenario_guide / environment_matrix / workflow_recommendation / user_guide`

**Signature:** `about(format='markdown'); api_reference(format='markdown'); scenario_guide(domain=None, environment=None, scenario=None, format='markdown'); environment_matrix(format='markdown'); workflow_recommendation(domain=None, environment=None, scenario=None, format='markdown'); user_guide(format='markdown')`

**Purpose:** In-package documentation and onboarding helpers.

**Why this API exists:** Community tools need a discoverable explanation layer. These functions let users ask the package itself what it does, when to use each API, and which workflows fit their domain or environment.

**When to use it:** Use when onboarding a new lab, writing docs, teaching users, or generating scenario-specific guidance from Python or the CLI.

**Returns:** Markdown/text/JSON guide content

**Accepted inputs / context:**

- optional domain/environment filters

**Inspect these outputs:**

- about
- API catalog
- scenario playbooks
- environment matrix
- workflow guide

**Recommended environments:** notebook, python_script, cli_batch

### `hot_case_gallery / similarity_playbook / project_homepage_html / project_playground_html`

**Signature:** `hot_case_gallery(...); similarity_playbook(...); project_homepage_html(version='0.12.0'); project_playground_html(version='0.12.0')`

**Purpose:** Provide shareable, high-attention case ideas plus a static project-homepage starting point.

**Why this API exists:** Community adoption grows faster when the package already knows how to explain itself through timely examples and a reusable project page.

**When to use it:** Use when you want demos that can travel on social, in blog posts, on GitHub Pages, or in onboarding decks.

**Returns:** Markdown/JSON guides and a self-contained HTML string

**Accepted inputs / context:**

- optional audience/window filters

**Inspect these outputs:**

- hot cases
- similarity guidance
- homepage HTML

**Recommended environments:** python_script, cli_batch, notebook

## similarity analysis

### `compare_series`

**Signature:** `compare_series(left, right, *, left_timestamps=None, right_timestamps=None, left_name='left', right_name='right', n_points=256) -> SimilarityReport`

**Purpose:** Compare two raw trajectories using shape, DTW, trend, derivative, and spectral similarity.

**Why this API exists:** Cross-disciplinary users often want to say 'does this curve look like that one?' before they want a full forecasting or classification model. This API gives that question a structured answer.

**When to use it:** Use for GitHub star growth, crypto or commodity price windows, launch-week traffic curves, and any pair of trajectories where shape matters.

**Returns:** SimilarityReport

**Accepted inputs / context:**

- univariate arrays
- multichannel arrays
- optional timestamps

**Inspect these outputs:**

- similarity_score
- component_scores
- to_summary_card_markdown()
- to_narrative_report()

**Recommended environments:** notebook, python_script, cli_batch, pandas_pipeline

### `compare_profiles`

**Signature:** `compare_profiles(left, right, *, left_name='left profile', right_name='right profile') -> SimilarityReport`

**Purpose:** Compare two tsontology profiles or raw datasets at the ontology-axis level.

**Why this API exists:** Sometimes raw units and scales differ too much for direct shape matching, but the datasets are still structurally analogous. Profile similarity answers that higher-level question.

**When to use it:** Use for cross-domain analogies, benchmark curation, or when you want to explain that two datasets are 'the same kind of temporal problem'.

**Returns:** SimilarityReport

**Accepted inputs / context:**

- DatasetProfile
- SeriesProfile
- or raw inputs accepted by profile_dataset

**Inspect these outputs:**

- overall_axis_similarity
- dynamic_similarity
- multivariate_similarity
- metadata['axis_similarity']

**Recommended environments:** notebook, python_script, ml_benchmark, pandas_pipeline

### `rolling_similarity`

**Signature:** `rolling_similarity(left, right, *, window, step=1, left_timestamps=None, right_timestamps=None, n_points=128) -> list[dict]`

**Purpose:** Track how similarity changes over aligned rolling windows.

**Why this API exists:** Many high-traffic stories are regime stories: BTC and gold are similar in some windows but not others, and launch-week growth patterns drift over time.

**When to use it:** Use for windowed market comparisons, launch tracking, and changing relationships over time.

**Returns:** list of per-window similarity summaries

**Accepted inputs / context:**

- pair of arrays or multichannel arrays
- window length
- optional timestamps

**Inspect these outputs:**

- similarity_score
- shape_similarity
- trend_similarity
- spectral_similarity

**Recommended environments:** notebook, python_script, pandas_pipeline

## agent driving

### `AgentDriver / agent_drive / agent_context`

**Signature:** `AgentDriver(goal='understand_dataset', budget='lean|balanced|deep', ...); agent_drive(data, reference=None, goal=..., budget=...); agent_context(profile_or_similarity_report, budget='lean')`

**Purpose:** Let an agent or application choose the cheapest useful tsontology workflow and export a compact context bundle.

**Why this API exists:** LLM agents often waste tokens by running too many analyses and by carrying oversized intermediate reports. This API chooses a small workflow first, stops early when the signal is already clear, and compresses the result into a reusable context payload.

**When to use it:** Use when tsontology sits inside an agent loop, a notebook assistant, a retrieval pipeline, or a batch report generator that needs compact summaries.

**Returns:** AgentDriveResult or compact context dict/markdown/json

**Accepted inputs / context:**

- the same raw inputs accepted by profile_dataset or compare_series
- optional reference trajectory for comparison goals
- a goal string that explains what the agent is trying to solve

**Inspect these outputs:**

- result.steps
- result.compact_context
- result.token_saving_rationale
- result.to_context_markdown()

**Recommended environments:** notebook, python_script, cli_batch, pandas_pipeline, ml_benchmark

## Notes by environment

### Jupyter or interactive notebook (`notebook`)

- Best environment for first contact with a new dataset.
- Combine with about(), api_reference(), and scenario_guide() to onboard collaborators.

### Plain Python script or package pipeline (`python_script`)

- Good fit when you want deterministic artifact generation.
- The registry API is easiest to integrate from scripts.

### CLI and shell batch jobs (`cli_batch`)

- Useful for data release pipelines and benchmark registries.
- Parquet support depends on the runtime having a parquet engine installed.

### Pandas / parquet / tabular data pipeline (`pandas_pipeline`)

- Ideal when your storage layer is already tabular.
- Longitudinal columns such as subject, visit, time, and channel unlock richer interpretation.

### Neuro stack (MNE-like / xarray-like / ROI arrays) (`neuro_stack`)

- Use typed wrappers when you want explicit metadata such as TR or channel names.
- tsontology complements, rather than replaces, domain packages.

### ML benchmark or evaluation pipeline (`ml_benchmark`)

- Best environment when you need repeatable cards across many datasets.
- The package is descriptive infrastructure, not a benchmark runner.

- A dataset card is descriptive, not a substitute for task-specific evaluation.
- Reliability scores should be reported alongside the axes.


# tsontology recommended workflow

**domain:** generic  
**environment:** notebook

**Recommended input setup:** Start with arrays or DataFrames; move to typed wrappers if semantic metadata matter.

**Priority axes:** predictability, drift_nonstationarity, trendness, rhythmicity, complexity

## Suggested steps

1. Organize the dataset in the most semantically faithful input form rather than stripping metadata too early.
2. Run profile_dataset(...) with domain-specific metadata such as sampling_rate, TR, channel names, visit columns, or explicit timestamps whenever available.
3. Inspect the priority axes together with reliability, notes, and domain/plugin metrics rather than reading any single score in isolation.
4. Export a dataset card so the profile can travel into papers, benchmark registries, or internal data catalogs.
5. Use task hints and reliability notes to guide model-family choice, validation design, and communication of caveats.

**Export tip:** Use profile.to_markdown() or profile.to_card_markdown() while exploring interactively.

## Relevant scenarios

- `profile_dataset(records_or_table)`


# tsontology similarity guide

Similarity in tsontology is not one thing. Sometimes you care about raw point-by-point shape, sometimes about shared rhythm, and sometimes about structural similarity at the dataset level.

## When to use raw-series similarity

Use raw-series similarity when two trajectories live on roughly compatible time scales and you want to ask whether the visible shape or timing is alike.

## When to use profile similarity

Use profile similarity when the datasets come from different scales, units, or observation modes, but you still want to compare their structural character.

## Best first moves

- Decide whether you are comparing levels, returns, increments, or z-scored shape.
- Preserve timestamps and event annotations instead of stripping them away.
- Use rolling similarity for regimes that probably change over time.
- Show both the numeric similarity report and a simple overlay plot.

## API pattern

- `compare_series(left, right) for direct shape comparison`
- `rolling_similarity(left, right, window=...) for changing relationships over time`
- `compare_profiles(left, right) for dataset-level structural analogies`

## How to explain the outputs to non-method users

- High shape similarity means the curves visibly move alike.
- High spectral similarity means the rhythms match even if peaks happen at slightly different times.
- High profile similarity means the datasets behave like the same kind of temporal problem even if the raw numbers differ.

# tsontology agent-driving guide

Agent-driving is a lightweight orchestration layer that helps an LLM or application choose the smallest useful tsontology workflow and export a compact context bundle.

## Token-saving principles

- Start with the cheapest informative move.
- Stop early when the signal is already clear.
- Upgrade to structural comparison only when raw shape is ambiguous or the question is structural.
- Render summary cards and narratives from existing profiles instead of recomputing analysis.
- Pass compact context bundles back into the agent instead of full raw reports when the next step only needs the gist.

## Main API

- `AgentDriver(goal=..., budget='lean|balanced|deep')`
- `agent_drive(data, reference=None, goal=..., budget=...)`
- `agent_context(profile_or_similarity_report, budget='lean')`

## Budget modes

- **lean:** Do the cheapest sufficient move and stop when the signal is clear.
- **balanced:** Add structural/profile comparison when ambiguity remains.
- **deep:** Allow rolling similarity and a fuller context bundle for regime-sensitive questions.

## Good goal prompts

- Explain this dataset to a non-technical collaborator
- Decide whether repo A's growth curve resembles repo B
- Compare these two assets but keep the context compact for another LLM step
- Find out whether two datasets are the same kind of temporal problem

# tsontology case gallery

These are high-visibility, cross-disciplinary time-series cases where tsontology is meant to be useful.

## Web/app traffic and product analytics

**case key:** `web_product_traffic`  
**domains:** generic, product, web, traffic  
**audiences:** general, product, operations, cross-disciplinary  
**environments:** notebook, python_script, pandas_pipeline, cli_batch

**Why people care:** Traffic, conversion, and usage metrics are easy to explain to broad audiences and are often the first time-series many teams operationalize.

**Typical data:** Hourly or daily sessions, clicks, conversions, campaign spikes, release-day shocks, and multi-metric product dashboards.

**Common questions:**

- Is this mostly trend plus seasonality, or is it dominated by launches and bursts?
- Should we trust simple forecasting baselines, or is the system drifting too much?
- Which metrics move together strongly enough to justify multivariate modelling?

**Where tsontology helps:** It gives a plain-language structural readout before teams jump into forecasting, anomaly detection, or KPI attribution debates.

**Recommended entrypoints:**

- `profile_dataset(dataframe, domain='traffic')`
- `profile_dataset(array, domain='product')`
- `profile.to_summary_card_markdown()`

**What to show non-method users:**

- summary card with top axes and plain-language meanings
- narrative report explaining whether the data are steady, seasonal, bursty, or drifting
- dataset card attached to experiment or dashboard documentation

**Practical value:**

- Explain why weekly seasonality matters before model selection.

**case key:** `retail_demand_operations`  
**domains:** generic, retail, operations, supply_chain  
**audiences:** general, operations, cross-disciplinary  
**environments:** notebook, python_script, pandas_pipeline, cli_batch

**Why people care:** Demand planning is a high-visibility time-series use case because it directly affects stockouts, staffing, and revenue.

**Typical data:** Store- or SKU-level sales, promotion calendars, replenishment signals, and holiday-driven demand waves.

**Common questions:**

- How strong is the predictable seasonality relative to promo shocks?
- How heterogeneous are stores or SKUs?
- Should validation split by time only, or by store/product group as well?

**Where tsontology helps:** It clarifies whether the dataset is mostly rhythmic, drift-heavy, bursty, or highly heterogeneous across units.

**Recommended entrypoints:**

- `profile_dataset(dataframe, domain='operations')`
- `profile.to_summary_card_markdown()`
- `profile.to_narrative_report()`

**What to show non-method users:**

- one-page summary card for merchants or operators
- narrative report that translates axes into replenishment implications

**Practical value:**

- Separate seasonality-heavy planning problems from campaign-shock problems.

**case key:** `energy_load_and_smart_metering`  
**domains:** generic, energy, operations, environmental  
**audiences:** general, operations, cross-disciplinary  
**environments:** notebook, python_script, pandas_pipeline, ml_benchmark

**Why people care:** Energy load is a classic public-facing time-series use case with clear seasonality, weather sensitivity, and operational stakes.

**Typical data:** Building load curves, feeder demand, smart-meter cohorts, distributed sensors, and weather-linked covariates.

**Common questions:**

- How much of the signal is predictable daily/weekly rhythm?
- Do sites behave similarly enough to pool them?
- Are drifts or regime changes strong enough to break static models?

**Where tsontology helps:** It turns those questions into a structured profile that is easy to compare across sites or benchmark datasets.

**Recommended entrypoints:**

- `profile_dataset(array, domain='energy')`
- `profile_dataset(dataframe, domain='energy')`
- `profile.to_card_json()`

**What to show non-method users:**

- plain-language summary of rhythm, drift, and heterogeneity

**Practical value:**

- Show when seasonality dominates enough for strong baseline models.
- Flag when regime changes or drifts make historic averages unreliable.

## Wearable, digital biomarker, or recovery cohort

**case key:** `wearable_longitudinal_cohort`  
**domains:** wearable, clinical  
**audiences:** general, clinical, cross-disciplinary  
**environments:** notebook, python_script, pandas_pipeline, cli_batch

**Why people care:** Wearables are one of the highest-traffic modern time-series domains because they connect research, product, health, and consumer reporting.

**Typical data:** Heart rate, activity, sleep, recovery, repeated visits, device adherence gaps, and subject-level timelines.

**Common questions:**

- Is the problem dominated by adherence gaps and irregular follow-up?
- Are people more different from each other than days are within each person?
- Should evaluation split by subject, visit, or time?

**Where tsontology helps:** It exposes longitudinal instability, dropout imbalance, and heterogeneity in a way clinicians and product teams can both read.

**Recommended entrypoints:**

- `profile_dataset(dataframe, domain='wearable')`
- `profile.to_summary_card_markdown()`
- `profile.to_narrative_report()`

**case key:** `icu_irregular_monitoring`  
**domains:** clinical  
**audiences:** general, clinical, cross-disciplinary  
**environments:** notebook, python_script, pandas_pipeline, cli_batch

**Why people care:** Irregular clinical monitoring is high-impact because timestamp quality, sparsity, and bursts of interventions strongly affect downstream claims.

**Typical data:** Irregular vitals, labs, interventions, alarms, asynchronous channels, and mixed event-plus-signal timelines.

**Common questions:**

- Are timing irregularity and missingness the main difficulty?
- Does the dataset behave like a sparse event process or a dense physiological signal?
- How much do patients differ structurally?

**Where tsontology helps:** It keeps observation structure honest and gives non-method collaborators a reasoned explanation for why naive regular-grid assumptions may fail.

**Recommended entrypoints:**

- `profile_dataset(IrregularTimeSeriesInput(...), domain='clinical')`
- `profile_dataset(records_or_dataframe, domain='clinical')`
- `profile.to_narrative_report()`

**What to show non-method users:**

- narrative report for clinicians, data stewards, or protocol teams
- summary card that highlights irregularity, burstiness, and reliability caveats

**Practical value:**

- Document why explicit timestamps must be preserved.
- Flag when event bursts dominate over smooth trends.

## Resting-state or task fMRI cohort

**case key:** `resting_state_fmri`  
**domains:** fmri, neuro  
**audiences:** general, neuroscience, cross-disciplinary  
**environments:** notebook, python_script, neuro_stack, ml_benchmark

**Why people care:** fMRI is a flagship scientific time-series setting where multivariate coupling and cohort heterogeneity matter as much as single-node signals.

**Typical data:** Subject × time × ROI matrices, network labels, resting-state or task blocks, and cohort-level comparisons.

**Common questions:**

- How networked is the dataset?
- How much do subjects differ in temporal organization?
- Should models be framed as multivariate/network-aware rather than independent ROI series?

**Where tsontology helps:** It turns networked temporal structure into a dataset card that non-method collaborators can actually read.

**Recommended entrypoints:**

- `profile_dataset(FMRIInput(...))`
- `profile.to_summary_card_markdown()`
- `profile.to_narrative_report()`

**What to show non-method users:**

- plain-language summary of coupling, heterogeneity, and rhythmic low-frequency structure
- narrative report suitable for supplements, preregistration, or lab onboarding

**Practical value:**

- Communicate why multivariate structure cannot be ignored.
- Summarize cohort-level differences before benchmarking new models.

**Data to track:**

- daily close or hourly close for BTC
- spot gold or gold ETF close
- Brent or WTI close
- major policy or geopolitical timestamps

**Similarity questions worth asking:**

- When does BTC move more like a risk asset and when does it resemble a stress-sensitive macro series?
- Do gold and oil share the same shock windows or only the same broad trend?
- Which pair becomes more similar during geopolitical escalation?

**Recommended API:**

- `compare_series(btc_returns, gold_returns)`
- `rolling_similarity(gold_returns, oil_returns, window=20)`
- `compare_profiles(window_a, window_b)`

**What non-method users should see:**

- a rolling similarity chart for pairs of assets
- a narrative report translating similarity changes into regime language

**Notes:**

- Use returns or z-scored prices when scales differ wildly.
- Rolling similarity is usually more informative than one score for the whole year.

## Launch-week traffic, signup bursts, and docs demand

**case key:** `launch_traffic_vs_signup_conversion`  
**Likely attention window:** Any 90-day launch or campaign window
